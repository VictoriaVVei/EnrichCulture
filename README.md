### 3. Our goals
> We aim to develop a web app that promotes cultural diversity and ensures that no culture is left behind. Our primary feature is a post function that allows users to share their own culture and preserve it within their posts. We intend to categorize cultures based on various topics such as region, style, and people. Additionally, users will have the ability to leave comments on the posts and provide feedback to the post owner.

### 4.The mission statement:
> Inheriting history and culture

### 5.The problem statement:
> With rapid technological progress in global society, mainstream culture has gradually overshadowed tradition, so there is a huge risk of cultural erosion. Moreover, limited resources and the inherent complexity of traditional civilizations make long-term sustainability difficult, and existing platforms cannot effectively promote and protect the richness and diversity of global cultures loss.
